## 2026-04-24 (overnight pass) — ✅ Phase 8 automation, reports, compliance

Kirk said "cram as much as you can — I am going home, you have all
night!" Everything below shipped as atomic commits to `main` between
evening and morning. All graceful-without-creds: drop the right env
var on Railway and the feature lights up with no code change.

| Commit  | Scope                                                                                                                                      |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 2f16629 | `/admin/budget-rules` + `/admin/templates` + `/admin/cadences` CRUD (with variable substitution tests, step editor, execution settings)    |
| b002072 | Radar financial pulse strip (Spent MTD / Budget / Revenue MTD with progress bar + over-budget banner) + Storm 6-hour revenue sync          |
| d79be24 | `/reports` rebuilt with Activity / Funnel / ROI / Expenses tabs + URL-driven range picker (7d/30d/90d/YTD); Resend expense emails          |
| eb4a98c | AI tone training first-login modal + /settings retrain card. Samples persist even if `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is missing                        |
| 4593f5d | Cadence automation wired end-to-end: consent + quiet hours + dispatcher + Inngest enrollment on stage change + 5-min dispatch cron         |
| 3c2094f | Seed 5 message templates + 3 starter cadences on first boot (only when tables empty); execution stats pills on /admin/cadences             |
| f97c405 | CAN-SPAM compliance: HMAC-signed /unsubscribe + RFC 8058 one-click POST + List-Unsubscribe headers + legal footer on every automated email |
| f43ce06 | `/admin/cadence-queue` — approve-and-send or drop cadence steps marked requireApproval, with audit log                                     |

**What this means practically — flip these env vars and the whole
automation stack comes alive:**

1. Add `RESEND_API_KEY` + `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` → expense approval
   emails + cadence email sends start going out.
2. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` → rep tone extraction + AI draft drawer
   start using Haiku 4.5 / Sonnet 4.6.
3. Add Inngest signing keys → 6-hour Storm revenue sync + 5-minute
   cadence dispatch start firing.
4. Add `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` (Phase 8.1 still) → cadence SMS sends
   light up. Today they dry-run with a clear "twilio_not_configured"
   outcome.

**New surfaces Kirk can click through this morning:**

- `/admin/budget-rules` — tenant-wide default auto-seeded; add
  per-market or per-rep overrides.
- `/admin/templates` — 5 canonical templates pre-seeded. Variable
  palette + live preview + SMS char meter.
- `/admin/cadences` — 3 cadences pre-seeded. Step editor with offset
  presets, per-step approval toggle, timeline preview. Per-row
  execution pills (scheduled / sent / blocked / pending).
- `/admin/cadence-queue` — any step marked "requires approval" lands
  here with Approve & Send or Drop buttons.
- `/reports` — four tabs with real data. Works with zero data shown
  gracefully; lights up as activity accumulates.
- `/settings` right column — "AI tone" card shows status + summary
  - Retrain button. First-login modal still triggers for fresh REPs.
- `/unsubscribe` — public, no-auth. One-click kill for any emailed
  contact. Audit-logged.

**Compliance note (CAN-SPAM §7.5):** every automated email now ships
with the tenant legal name + physical address + a working unsubscribe
link. `List-Unsubscribe` and `List-Unsubscribe-Post` headers mean
Gmail / Apple Mail render their native unsubscribe button. One-click
unsubscribe flips `Contact.emailConsent=false` when the last
subscribed address is removed.

**Schema touch-ups that auto-applied:** none — everything above reused
existing tables. `instrumentation.ts` only added idempotent data
seeding (no DDL), so the deploy came up clean.

## 2026-04-23 (autonomous pass #2) — 🚧 Phase 4 foundations landed

Kirk fired a 4-hour autonomous build on top of the freshly-shipped
Phase 2+3 baseline. Four Phase 4 scaffolds landed as atomic commits:

| Commit  | Scope                                                                                                                         |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 6428685 | Hit Lists CRUD — /lists hub (card grid), /lists/[id] detail with drag-reorder + per-stop complete, "+ New hit list" drawer    |
| c7c03c5 | /map page with graceful Google Maps degradation — renders pins when `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is set, fallback pin list otherwise |
| d803180 | Prospect queue — /admin/scraped-leads with approve→Partner / reject-with-reason; ScrapeSource enum expanded to 10 values      |
| d2fd938 | NMLS ingestion adapter (streaming CSV) + generic `runIngest` pipeline + `scripts/ingest-nmls.ts` CLI                          |

**What this means practically:**

- Every rep can now plan a day: open /lists, hit "+ New", drop
  partners onto the list, drag to reorder, check off as they visit
  (each check-in writes a VISIT activity to the partner).
- /map works _today_ as a pin list — the moment Kirk drops a Google
  Maps key on Railway it upgrades to full interactive pins with a
  side detail rail. Drawing + Places libs are already requested in
  the loader.
- The ingestion pipeline end-to-end: NMLS adapter (or any future
  adapter) emits `ProspectCandidate` rows → base runner dedupes
  against `ScrapedLead.dedupHash` → human approver hits /admin/
  scraped-leads → one click becomes a Partner in NEW_LEAD stage with
  a full audit trail.

**Phase 4 items still to land:**

1. Google Maps key provisioning (blocked on Kirk).
2. Territory lasso + "In this area" / "Prospects in this area"
   panels on /map (unlocks with the key).
3. State licensing-board adapters (CO DORA, KS KREC, CO/KS insurance
   depts). Same pipeline as NMLS, different parsers.
4. Overture Maps loader + Google Places live-refresh fallback.
5. Cron wiring for weekly runs (Railway cron or GitHub Actions).
6. Apollo enrichment on Partner promotion (blocked on `APOLLO_API_KEY`).
7. Routing deep-links + per-stop driving order.

**⚠️ DB migration note:**
Auto-migrate was reverted in `7b46bc6` because the Dockerfile change
was unstable. Commit `d803180` added new `ScrapeSource` enum values
(NMLS, STATE_REALTY, STATE_INSURANCE, OVERTURE, CHAMBER,
STORM_CLOUD). Run once against the Railway Postgres to pick them up:

```
pnpm --filter @partnerradar/db exec prisma db push
```

The existing /admin/scraped-leads page won't crash without this
migration — it only filters on status (no new values there). But the
NMLS ingestion CLI (`scripts/ingest-nmls.ts`) _will_ fail until the
enum is synced, because it writes `source: 'NMLS'` to ScrapeJob.

---

## 2026-04-23 — ✅ Phase 2 + Phase 3 SHIPPED

Kirk said "continue" and Cowork ran Phases 2+3 through to completion in
one sitting. Everything is live on Railway once the new commits deploy.

### Phase 2 — Partners core (SPEC §6.2)

| Commit  | Scope                                                                                                       |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| b82f3c7 | Partner detail page + Activate → mock Storm Cloud → 🎈 balloon celebration (prefers-reduced-motion honored) |
| bd8e034 | Contacts + Tasks + Appointments drawers wired (dashed-blue "+ New" pattern per SPEC §3.13)                  |
| 905a522 | New Partner drawer on `/partners` list + server-side search (companyName / PR-#### / city)                  |
| 23c0f73 | ⌘K global command palette — partners + contacts + tasks, debounced, keyboard-nav                            |

**What works now:**

- `/partners/[id]` 3-col top (Contacts / Info / Activity rail) + bottom split (Tasks / Appointments / Files).
- Contacts: add / mark-primary / delete via row actions.
- Tasks: create via drawer, complete with optimistic checkbox, priority pills.
- Appointments: create via drawer that mirrors Storm Cloud's event modal. Type pill on each row.
- Stage dropdown + Activate button fire `changeStage` / `activatePartner` server actions with audit trail.
- Activate button (manager+) runs mock Storm Cloud push, persists `stormCloudId`, fires balloons 🎈, haptic buzz on mobile.
- `/partners` list: stage filter sidebar + toolbar with "+ New" drawer + search box + live `q=` URL param.
- ⌘K / Ctrl+K anywhere pops a centered palette, jumps to any partner/contact/task in your market scope.

### Phase 3 — Admin + Settings (SPEC §6.3)

| Commit  | Scope                                                                                              |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 62c8a14 | Admin shell (sidebar + overview) + `/admin/users` (invite, roles, markets, deactivate, delete)     |
| aad07c5 | `/admin/markets` CRUD (name, timezone, lat/lng center, scrape radius, CAN-SPAM address)            |
| aab27fc | `/admin/audit-log` — filterable by user / entity / action / date range, diff drawer on each row    |
| c8a9c0a | `/settings` — profile, avatar palette, addresses, route defaults, map app, notifications, password |

**What works now:**

- `/admin` dashboard tiles to sub-pages with live counts.
- `/admin/users`: Invite user drawer → returns temp password to copy/share until Resend is wired. Per-row menu: Edit role+markets, Reset password, Deactivate/Reactivate, Delete (ADMIN only, refuses if user has activity history). Self-row guarded.
- `/admin/markets`: CRUD with shared drawer. Delete refuses if partners or users are still attached.
- `/admin/audit-log`: ADMIN-only; every mutation across the app writes a row; clickable "View diff" shows the full JSON payload.
- `/settings`: profile form with live Avatar preview, 10-color palette picker, home/office addresses, route-start default, map app preference, notification toggles (task-due / stage / activation / mentions), sound effects. Password card with current/new/confirm + auto-invalidation of other sessions via `tokenVersion` bump.

Every write-path goes through `assertCanEdit` / `assertIsManagerPlus` / `assertIsAdmin` helpers and emits an `AuditLog` entry with `diff`.

### Deploy state

| Piece     | Value                                                                                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| GitHub    | `kirkd84/Partner-CRM` · `main` is the green tip                                                  |
| Railway   | `Partner-CRM` service + `Postgres` service, both Online — new builds auto-triggered by each push |
| Web URL   | `https://partner-crm-production.up.railway.app`                                                  |
| DB        | Railway Postgres — no new migrations required for Phase 2/3 (schema was already comprehensive)   |
| Auto-push | `scripts/cowork-push.sh` used for every push, zero prompts                                       |

## 📍 Next up — Phase 4 (Map, Hit List, Routes, Territory Lasso, Prospect Ingestion)

Phase 4 is the mobile-first tour planner + the territory prospecting
tool. Scope expanded on 2026-04-23 per Kirk's product direction.

### Base map + routing (SPEC §6.4)

- `/map` page — interactive Google Maps with partner pins colored by
  stage, bounded by the user's active markets.
- Hit List builder — save curated lists of partners to visit;
  drag-reorder; TSP-ish optimize.
- Routes — given a start (HOME / OFFICE / LAST_STOP / CUSTOM) and a
  hit list, generate a driving order, deep-link to Google/Apple Maps.
- Appointments linked to routes ("stops") so the visit auto-logs a
  check-in when a rep starts navigation.

### Territory lasso (NEW — Kirk's ask)

Sales managers draw a polygon (or circle / rectangle) on the map via
the Google Maps Drawing library. Two panels surface side-by-side:

1. **In this area (existing)** — every Partner we already track whose
   lat/lng falls inside the polygon, dedupe-safe, one-click jump to
   detail.
2. **Prospects in this area** — businesses we don't yet have, drawn
   from the prospect ingestion pipeline below. Each row has "+ Add as
   partner" and "+ Add to hit list" buttons. Dedupe against existing
   Partners by name + normalized address.

Polygon results are cached in `ScrapedLead` with a 14–30 day TTL keyed
by `(polygonGeohash, icpType)` so the same manager re-lassoing the
same area tomorrow is free. Save-as-territory lets managers name
polygons (e.g. "Wheat Ridge corridor") and pin them to the market.

### Prospect ingestion pipeline (NEW — legal, free sources first)

Decision made 2026-04-23: **no Zillow / LinkedIn scraping** — ToS
risk, active enforcement, and the free alternatives cover most of
what we need. Instead we build our own ingestion jobs against public
data. Each feeds the `ScrapedLead` table with dedupe logic.

Source priority:

1. **NMLS Consumer Access** (federal, free) — every licensed mortgage
   broker + loan officer in the US. Bulk download, weekly refresh.
   Covers ~100% of the mortgage-broker ICP.
2. **State real estate commissions** — CO DORA, KS KREC first
   (Kirk's active markets). Per-state adapter, weekly refresh. Covers
   realtor + broker licensees.
3. **State insurance department producer databases** — CO Division of
   Insurance, KS Department of Insurance first. Covers insurance
   agents.
4. **Overture Maps** (open data from Microsoft/Meta/Amazon/TomTom, no
   license fee) — 60M+ global places with category tags. Used to fill
   gaps for general-contractor / HVAC / plumbing / landscaping /
   restoration ICPs.
5. **Chamber of Commerce member directories** — per-chamber scraper,
   rate-limited, respect robots.txt. Nice-to-have, not a hard dep.
6. **Google Places Nearby Search** — the live-refresh layer on top of
   1–5. Hit when a lasso draws somewhere we haven't seeded yet.
   Cached aggressively.
7. **Storm Cloud historical touchpoints** (parking-lot — pending Storm
   dev team exposing an endpoint) — partners who've already referred
   projects into Storm. If we get this, it's the moat.

### Enrichment

When a prospect is promoted to Partner, we enrich the contact card via
a paid B2B API (Apollo or Clearbit — $50–200/mo) to pull
decision-maker name, email, phone, LinkedIn URL. This replaces any
temptation to scrape LinkedIn directly. Apollo gets the shortlist for
v1 based on their roofing-industry coverage.

### Blocked on Kirk (creds needed)

- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` with Maps JS + Drawing + Places + Directions
  enabled → base map, lasso, prospect search, address autocomplete.
- `APOLLO_API_KEY` (or Clearbit equivalent) → enrichment on prospect →
  partner promotion. Optional for Phase 4 ship; degrades to manual.
- Storm Cloud decision — does Storm have a market-prospects / past-
  referrer feed we could consume? If yes, adds a source #7. If no,
  sources 1–6 still ship.
- `RESEND_API_KEY` + DKIM/SPF on `rooftechnologies.com` — Phase 3
  invite magic-links. Not Phase 4 blocking.
- `R2_*` Cloudflare bucket — Phase 2 file uploads. Not Phase 4
  blocking.
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` → Phase 7 AI Follow-ups.
- `TWILIO_*` → Phase 7 SMS outbound.

Without Maps key: the map page renders a static marker list and the
lasso becomes a city/ZIP picker. Base routing still works. Ingestion
jobs run independent of the map key.

### Phase 4 build order when we kick off

1. Google Maps wrapper component + partner pins from DB (1 day)
2. Hit List CRUD + drag-reorder + TSP-ish optimize (1 day)
3. Routes + deep-link to Google/Apple Maps (1 day)
4. Lasso drawing tool + "in this area (existing partners)" panel (1 day)
5. NMLS + CO realtor + KS realtor + CO insurance ingestion jobs with
   `ScrapedLead` writes + weekly cron (2 days)
6. Overture Maps loader for commercial ICPs (0.5 day)
7. Google Places live-refresh fallback + polygon cache (1 day)
8. "Prospects in this area" panel + dedupe + "Add as partner" /
   "Add to hit list" buttons (1 day)
9. Save-as-territory + named polygons per market (0.5 day)
10. Apollo enrichment on promotion (0.5 day, gated on key)
